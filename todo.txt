3. Remove the ghost argument from the pacman.move()
4. Why there are a few clash(), catched() methods in the pacman class?
5. Revise getRow/getCal approach. The binding a string to number looks like a shit
6. Since clash() will be moved to GameManager class, the clashPacman can be removed from the ghost class
7. Move to Python 3
